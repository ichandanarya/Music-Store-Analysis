# Music-Store-Analysis

A collection of SQL queries answering business questions for a music store dataset. The queries cover easy, moderate, and advanced levels and demonstrate joins, aggregations, window functions, and subqueries across typical tables like employee, customer, invoice, invoice_line, track, album, artist, and genre. The questions and their solutions are in Music Store Database.sql.

## ‚ú® What‚Äôs inside

Question Set 1 ‚Äì Easy: quick insights (top employee by level, invoices by country, largest invoice totals, best city, best customer). 

Question Set 2 ‚Äì Moderate: multi-table analyses (rock listeners by email, top rock artists, tracks longer than average). 

Question Set 3 ‚Äì Advance: revenue by artist per customer, most popular genre per country using window functions, top spender by country.
